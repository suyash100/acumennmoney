This is a python(flask) based web application which is made for investment related calculations.

Here, I have made 3 APIs where ->
  1-> To calculate SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) amount needed to achieve a target value given an annual rate of return and a specified investment duration in years
  2-> To calculate number of withdrawals that can be made from an initial investment, given a withdrawal amount, withdrawal frequency, inflation rate, and rate of return, before the investment is depleted
  3-> To calculate the total amount of money that can be withdrawn from an initial investment, given a withdrawal amount, withdrawal frequency, inflation rate, rate of return, and investment duration
  
->You will find Code regarding all API endpoints in main.py file 
->All the HTML files are in templates folder which are responsible for taking data from backend and showing to user
